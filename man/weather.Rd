\details{
One year of daily weather observations collected from the Canberra airport
in Australia was obtained from the Australian Commonwealth Bureau of
Meteorology and processed to create this sample dataset for illustrating
data mining using R and Rattle.

The data has been processed to provide a target variable RainTomorrow
(whether there is rain on the following day - No/Yes) and a risk variable
`RISK_MM`` (how much rain recorded in millimeters). Various transformations
were performed on the source data. The dataset is quite small and is useful
only for repeatable demonstration of various data science operations.

The source dataset is Copyright by the Australian Commonwealth Bureau of
Meteorology and is provided as part of the rattle package with permission.

Data frame of 366 observations of 20 variables, one year of
daily observations of weather variables at Canberra airport in Australia
starting November 2007:
\itemize{
\item Date, The date of observation (a Date object).
\item MinTemp, The minimum temperature in degrees Celsius.
\item MaxTemp, The maximum temperature in degrees Celsius.
\item Rainfall, The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm.
\item Evaporation, The so-called Class A pan evaporation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am.
\item Sunshine, The number of hours of bright sunshine in the day.
\item WindGustSpeed, The speed (km/h) of the strongest wind gust in the 24 hours to midnight.
\item WindSpeed9am, Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 9am.
\item WindSpeed3pm, Wind speed (km/hr) averaged over 10 minutes prior to 3pm.
\item Humid9am, Relative humidity (percent) at 9am.
\item Humid3pm, Relative humidity (percent) at 3pm.
\item Pressure9am, Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 9am.
\item Pressure3pm, Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 3pm.
\item Cloud9am, Fraction of sky obscured by cloud at 9am. This is measured in "oktas", which are a unit of eigths. It records how many eigths of the sky are obscured by cloud. A 0 measure indicates completely clear sky whilst an 8 indicates that it is completely overcast.
\item Cloud3pm, Fraction of sky obscured by cloud (in "oktas": eighths) at 3pm. See Cload9am for a description of the values.
\item Temp9am, Temperature (degrees C) at 9am.
\item Temp3pm, Temperature (degrees C) at 3pm.
\item RainToday, Integer: 1 if precipitation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am exceeds 1mm, otherwise 0.
\item RISK_MM, The amount of rain. A kind of measure of the "risk".
\item RainTomorrow, The target variable. Did it rain tomorrow?
