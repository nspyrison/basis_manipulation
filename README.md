# spinifex

spinifex is a package that is compatiable and extends the package `tourr`. 
It builds the functionality for manual tours, and adds the ability for any 
tour to be rendered as `plotly` or `gganimate` objects. Touring is a class 
of dimensionality reducetion that orthogonally projects data from `p` down 
to `d` dimensions, take a small change in `p`-space and interpolates again. 
Manual tours manipulate a selected variable to explore the local structure,
particaularly effective after finding a interesting tour, perhaps via a 
guided tour.
